      <description> Fan Art and miscelaneous illustration  First ever known fan art for the instagram celebrity @bleuintheburg  Generally I do a lot of hand work that sits beside digital and web design work in the gallery.

      <description>Fugitive Ground is an ongoing collaboration with friends and fellow artists. The themes are centered around mindfulness, meditation, perception and art. The process of constructing print pieces, hosting workshops and developing web components provided the same kind of meditation prescribed by the project itself.  As development continues we can expect more print pieces and an evolving website. For now the website provides functionality for its contributors including general information, a mailing list, event information, and sun and moon data based on location.</description>

      <description>A brand is not necessarily visual. It’s a promise of an experience  Sean Adams, as referenced in brand thinking and the definition of brand
  The goal of this project was to create a versatile and novel identity for use as a personal brand. This kind of project is supposed to represent all of our talent, wit and narcissism. Realistically though I knew this identity had to be more about process, experimentation and play&amp;mdash;because thats who I am.</description>
