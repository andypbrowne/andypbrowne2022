  								<p>
									Typography is the style and appearance of printed matter. A typeface is a family of fonts (like Helvetica or Futura), and a font is a particular weight of a typeface (like light, regular, medium, condensed or bold). To properly employ type&mdash;point size, line length, leading, kerning, and tracking must all be considered. The goal is to be visually satisfying while preserving legibility and readability.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you want to sound smart: Color&mdash;Refers to teh appearance of the page that is effected by the amount of ink on the page, also by margins, binding, line width, type size, and line-height ratio.

                           <p>In 1976 AT&amp;T commissioned <em>Bell Centennial</em> for use in telephone directories. Designed by Matthew Carter to replace Bell Gothic, it was a typeface that made effective use of digital typesetting technology. Bell Centennial gets several more lines per page than Bell Gothic and it reduced calls to information because of its significantly higher legibility under adverse printing conditions&mdash;saving AT&amp;T many millions of dollars per year.</p>

                          <p><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> commissioned this typeface for use in financial tables with the goal of increasing legibility while condensing the letterforms to save space. Designed to be used at very small sizes&mdash;7-point or below&mdash;Retina departs from traditional letterforms altogeather to instaead provide letters that are dissimilar from one another as possible. Retina, in the words of the designers, fills in what the &ldquo;human eye needs and what the brain expects&rdquo; when reading very fine print. By playing up the differences between each letter, the designers have taken &ldquo;its essence, the thing that makes it this letter and not something else&rdquo; and amplified it. Notches, or ink traps, are cut into the glyphs to compensate for in spread on poor-quality paper. Many newspapers now use Retina not only for stock listing but also for sports cores, classified ads, movie and TV listing, and other high-density texts.</p>

                      <aside class="notes">
                          <p>Christian Schwartz desccribes the origins of the idea: &ldquo;The seed was planted for this face when I used Matthew Carter&rsquo;s Bell Centennial, originally designed to compensate for the printing methods and point sizes used in phone books, for display on some posters I designed in college. When you blow this tiny type up to large sizes, it looks as crazy as any mid-nineties postmodern deconstruction. I wanted to draw a face that had this same quality as its primary goal rather than a side effect.&rdquo;</p>
                          <p>Although 35 styles seems like an overwhelming number, each has been designed with a use in mind. Book and Regular give subtile choices in text weight, depending on background color, heaviness of inking, and whether the text will be reversed out. Light and Medium are more display-oriented, although Medium is excellent for text that will be reversed out and inked heavily on absorbent paper.</p>
                          <p>Bold can be matched with Light, Book or Regular for emphasis. Black matches with Medium, and Ultra should only be used for display, is its counterforms are very small.</p>
                          <p>The wides are meant for the mallest possible text, their counterforms are open enough and their x-heights so large that three to four point text is till readible.</p>
                          <p>The Normal and Condensed styles are the core of the family&mdash;the basic workhorses&mdash;and are more space-efficient than Wide. Condensed is usable for text at sizes where Compressed is just too narrow. &ldquo;The Extra Compressed styles were drawn with movie posters in mind&mdash;the tiny text ast the bottom is often illegible, so I tried to draw something readable in the same propoertion.</p>
