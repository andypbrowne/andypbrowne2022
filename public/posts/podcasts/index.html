<h2 class="serif-hero">Did you just say podcast? You’ve got my attention</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>ow do you find new podcasts? For me, discovery never happens by just browsing a podcast app. I am always looking for personal recommendations or hot tips on my twitter feed.  In the spirit of relevant recommendations, I am offering my go-to <strong>podcasts</strong> and <strong>favorite episodes</strong> broken down into mostly nonsensical categories of Road Trip, Morning Commuting, Sleep Aids, and Design Learning (Because I am a UX Designer).</p>

<p>What podcasts do you listen to and in which category do they fit? <a href="https://twitter.com/dtandyb/status/1115472627915722753">Let me know on twitter</a>.</p>

<h3 id="road-tripping">Road Tripping</h3>

<p>Here are a set of podcasts that are great for the road. Generally, these are longer in format and deserve undivided attention.</p>

<h3 id="morning-commuting">Morning Commuting</h3>

<p>It is fun to notice that a headphone wearing commuter is obviously listening to a podcast and not music. I like to imagine what exact podcast they are listening to. Is it a vanilla <em>This American Life</em>, <em>Serial</em>, big box comedy or true crime kind of show; or is it more of a deep cut</p>

<h3 id="sleep-aids">Sleep Aids</h3>

<p>Do you have trouble falling asleep. Much like a good National Public Radio (NPR) show these podcasts will quiet your mind and help you sleep. These podcasts are generally shorter in duration (~20min) which reduces the likelihood of falling asleep in the middle.</p>

<li><a href="http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/131">Episode 131 of the Big Web Show. Life After Typekit with Jeff Veen</a> - Jeffrey Zeldman speaks with Jeff Veen. One of his popular quotes things up. “I’ve been amazed at how often those outside the discipline of design assume that what designers do is decoration—likely because so much bad design simply <em>is</em> decoration. Good design isn’t. Good design is problem solving.” - <em>The Art and Science of Web Design</em> by Jeff Veen</li>

Answer, given the increasing complexity of our digital environment we should never blame users.</li>
<li><a href="https://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/city-of-boston/">The City of Boston from the Responsive Web Design Podcast</a> - Many amazing episodes to choose from here but this work on a civic website is memorable because of the relationship between user needs of citizens and how a responsive redesign offers an opportunity to organize a website’s content and features around that. When you listen to all of the episodes of this podcast like I have, you will notice that Ethan and Karen always ask the same set of questions. These must be really good questions because they get really fresh answers from every guest.</li>
<li><a href="https://designtomorrow.co/">Episode 11 of the Design Tomorrow Podcast. Getting Out of Our Own Way</a> - Host Christopher Butler covers in a sort of monologue fashion how we can practice better.
