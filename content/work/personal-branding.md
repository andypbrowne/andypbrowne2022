<span class="dropcap">T</span>he goal of this project was to create a versatile and novel identity for use as a personal brand. This kind of project is supposed to represent all of our talent, wit and narcissism. Realistically though I knew this identity had to be more about process, experimentation and play&mdash;because thats who I am.  

With this type of experimental approach we are free to really explore. In my exploration I sketched endlessly, re-learned Adobe Illustrator, carved a stamp, visited a laser cutting machine at Parsons and learned everything about SVG for the web.

        The months-long process culminated with a gift from my wife &mdash; who finally determined the thing was finished by ordering letterpress buiness cards from a teriffic place called <a href="http://hobanpress.com/">Hoban Press</a> out of Washington state. The thick card stock really shows how a simple design creates versitility and a memorable mark for a personal branding project.
